## Introduction

This tool can be used to work out **two measurements**

* The distance along the floor the lens of the projection
* The distance up the slope to the lens of the projection

## Download

Download the tool for Macintosh [here](https://github.com/autr/projection-tool/releases/download/1.0.0/projection-tool.app.zip)

## Configuration

Be sure to set up all the measurements properly! They are;

* **Box lower height** - the distance from the floor to the lower base of the box
* **Box angle** - the sloping angle of the box (use a spirit measure)
* **Box width** - width dimension
* **Box length** - length dimension
* **Ceiling** - the height of the ceiling where the projector is mounted
* **Lens distance** - the distance of the lens from the ceiling (important!)

## Method

Tie a weight to a piece of string and dangle it from the lens / ceiling.

## Results

Once these are set up you can use the two measurements to set up the position of box and projector.
